    // 🔹 1️⃣ Eager Initialization
    // Instance is created at the time of class loading.
    // ✅ Thread-safe by nature of classloading.
    // ❌ Problem: Instance is created even if it's never used. Wastes memory.
    private static final SingletonPatternExamples eagerInstance = new SingletonPatternExamples();

    public static SingletonPatternExamples getEagerInstance() {
        return eagerInstance;

    // 🔹 2️⃣ Lazy Initialization

    // ✅ Thread-safe because the method is synchronized.

    // 🔹 4️⃣ Double-Checked Locking

    // ❌ Problem (before Java 1.5): JVM could reorder instructions causing null issues.
    // ✅ Fix: Use `volatile` to prevent reordering and ensure visibility across threads.

                    doubleCheckInstance = new SingletonPatternExamples();
                }
            }
        }
        return doubleCheckInstance;

    // 🔐 Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
    private SingletonPatternExamples() {
        System.out.println("Singleton instance created");
    }

/*
 *
 * Problem in Double-Checked Locking (Before Java 1.5)
 * You might write code like this:

 * If (instance == null) {
 *     synchronized (SomeClass.class) {
 *         if (instance == null) {
 *             instance = new SomeClass(10);  // PROBLEM HERE
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * It looks correct, right? But before Java 1.5, the Java Memory Model allowed the JVM to reorder instructions for optimization.
 *
 * 🔍 What does "instruction reordering" mean?
 * When you do this:
 *
 * instance = new SomeClass();
 * It’s not a single step behind the scenes. It's really like this:
 *
 * Allocate memory for the object.
 *
 * Assign memory address to instance (instance != null now! ✅)
 *
 * Run the constructor (new SomeClass() logic).
 *
 * The problem: Step 2 (assignment) might happen before step 3 (construction)!
 *
 * ❗ So What Goes Wrong?
 * Imagine this happens:
 *
 * Thread 1 start creating the object.
 *
 * It assigns instance = something (not null), but the constructor hasn't finished yet!
 *
 * Thread 2 checks if (instance == null) → it's not null, so it uses it.
 *
 * Now thread 2 uses an object that’s not fully initialized! ❌
 *
 * This leads to bugs, crashes, or unique behavior.
 *
 * ✅ How volatile Fixes This
 * When you declare:
 *
 * private static volatile SomeClass instance;
 * The keyword volatile does two important things:
 *
 * Prevents instruction reordering:
 * The JVM is not allowed to move the assignment before constructor finishes.
 *
 * Ensures visibility across threads:
 * When Thread 1 sets instance, Thread 2 sees the latest value, not a stale cached one.
 *
 * So now, this is guaranteed:
 *
 * Object is fully constructed before any thread sees instance != null.
 *
 * ✅ Summary (Straightforward)
 * Without volatile	With volatile
 * JVM might reorder steps	Reordering is not allowed
 * Another thread sees incomplete object	Another thread sees fully built object
 * Risk of hard-to-find bugs	Safe multithreading behavior
 *
