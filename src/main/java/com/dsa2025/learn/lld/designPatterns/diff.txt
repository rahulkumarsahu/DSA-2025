You're right to notice that both Builder and Decorator can create variations of a product like a Coffee. But they serve very different purposes, and using one over the other depends on when and how the variation is applied.

Let's break it down with your coffee example:

☕ When to Use Builder Pattern for Coffee
Intent:
You are constructing a final Coffee object with all customizations at once, before it's used.

Characteristics:
The coffee is built step-by-step, then returned as a complete object.

No runtime flexibility — once built, it's fixed.

Focuses on the construction process.

Example:
class Coffee {
    private final boolean milk;
    private final boolean sugar;

    private Coffee(Builder builder) {
        this.milk = builder.milk;
        this.sugar = builder.sugar;
    }

    static class Builder {
        private boolean milk;
        private boolean sugar;

        Builder addMilk() {
            this.milk = true;
            return this;
        }

        Builder addSugar() {
            this.sugar = true;
            return this;
        }

        Coffee build() {
            return new Coffee(this);
        }
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        String desc = "Plain Coffee";
        if (milk) desc += " + Milk";
        if (sugar) desc += " + Sugar";
        return desc;
    }
}
Usage:
Coffee coffee = new Coffee.Builder()
    .addMilk()
    .addSugar()
    .build();

System.out.println(coffee.getDescription()); // Plain Coffee + Milk + Sugar
☕ When to Use Decorator Pattern for Coffee
Intent:
You have a core object (coffee) and you want to dynamically layer on features or behaviors — even at runtime.

Characteristics:
Focuses on runtime behavior enhancement.

Each "addon" is a wrapper that extends functionality.

More flexible and dynamic than Builder.

Example (same as before, dynamic):
Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee(); // runtime
if (wantMilk) {
    coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
}
if (wantSugar) {
    coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
}
This allows changing behavior based on runtime conditions, which Builder cannot do.

🆚 Key Differences in Coffee Context
Aspect	Builder Pattern	Decorator Pattern
Focus	Building a complete coffee object	Adding new behavior/responsibility
Customization	Compile-time (defined before build)	Runtime (can wrap/unwrap at runtime)
Result	A concrete object with set fields	A chain of objects wrapping each other
Flexibility	Less flexible after object is built	Highly flexible and extendable
Use case analogy	Customer orders and you make it to spec	You take basic coffee and add toppings live

🎯 Which to Use?
Use This	If You Want To...
Builder	Build an object with many fixed options before it's used.
Decorator	Add or change behavior at runtime in a flexible way.

Let me know if you want to see this in Go or Python too.

similarly explain for adapter and facade with example

Great! Let’s break down the difference between the Adapter and Facade patterns with clear explanations and real-world Java examples.

🔌 Adapter Pattern — "Make it Compatible"
📌 Intent:
Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

✅ When to Use:
You have existing classes with incompatible interfaces.

You want to reuse old code without modifying it.

You need to make two things work together.

☕ Real-World Analogy:
You have a 2-pin charger but the wall socket accepts 3-pin plugs. So you use an adapter.

🔧 Example:
Let’s say you have an old printer API that your new system can't directly use:

Legacy Interface:
class OldPrinter {
    void printDocument(String text) {
        System.out.println("Printing: " + text);
    }
}
Expected Interface:

interface ModernPrinter {
    void print(String text);
}
Adapter:
class PrinterAdapter implements ModernPrinter {
    private final OldPrinter oldPrinter;

    PrinterAdapter(OldPrinter oldPrinter) {
        this.oldPrinter = oldPrinter;
    }

    public void print(String text) {
        oldPrinter.printDocument(text);  // Delegates to old method
    }
}
Usage:
OldPrinter oldPrinter = new OldPrinter();
ModernPrinter printer = new PrinterAdapter(oldPrinter);
printer.print("Hello Adapter Pattern!");
🏠 Facade Pattern — "Simplify the Complex"
📌 Intent:
Provide a unified and simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

✅ When to Use:
You have a complex subsystem with many classes.

You want to hide internal complexity from the client.

You want to make the system easier to use.

🏡 Real-World Analogy:
A remote control (facade) simplifies how you interact with a home theater system (subsystem of TV, speakers, DVD player, etc.).

🔧 Example:
Subsystems:
class CPU {
    void start() { System.out.println("CPU started."); }
}
class Memory {
    void load() { System.out.println("Memory loaded."); }
}
class HardDrive {
    void read() { System.out.println("Reading data..."); }
}
Facade:
class ComputerFacade {
    private final CPU cpu;
    private final Memory memory;
    private final HardDrive hardDrive;

    ComputerFacade() {
        this.cpu = new CPU();
        this.memory = new Memory();
        this.hardDrive = new HardDrive();
    }

    void startComputer() {
        cpu.start();
        memory.load();
        hardDrive.read();
        System.out.println("Computer is ready to use.");
    }
}
Usage:
ComputerFacade computer = new ComputerFacade();
computer.startComputer();
🔍 Adapter vs Facade – Summary
Feature	Adapter	Facade
Purpose	Make incompatible interfaces work together	Simplify usage of a complex system
Focus	Interface compatibility	User-friendly interface
Changes existing code?	No – just wraps	No – just simplifies
Real-world example	Charger adapter	TV remote control
Inheritance/Composition	Often uses composition	Often uses composition

🧠 Final Thought:
Adapter: “I have something old, and I need to make it look like something new.”

Facade: “I have something complex, and I want to hide all the inner workings.”
