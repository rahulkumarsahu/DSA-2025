### ðŸ”´ Problem 1: Non-thread-safe `SimpleDateFormat` in multiple threads

1. here we are creating 2 object of "Simple date format" but the problem here is whenever thread execute it will create a 2 object similarly for below images like 10 threads or 1000 threads will create that much object which will not be that efficient in point of view of memory management

Each thread creates and uses this instance. But `SimpleDateFormat` is **not thread-safe**, leading to **data corruption or wrong output** if shared.

### ðŸ”´ Problem 2: Shared static `SimpleDateFormat` in multithreaded environment

 Here to solve above problems we have make date format as static object and multiple threads will be accessing that but here the problem is multiple threads will access that so not thread safe and we have to use locks or synchronize but its slow down the performance. 
### âœ… Fix: Use `ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat>` to give each thread its own formatter
