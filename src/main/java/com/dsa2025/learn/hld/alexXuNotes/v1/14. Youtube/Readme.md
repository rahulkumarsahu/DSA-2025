# Chapter 14: Design YouTube

## Introduction
YouTube is a massive video streaming platform supporting video uploads, playback, and various interactions. This chapter focuses on designing a scalable video streaming system with the following core features:
- **Fast video uploads**
- **Smooth video streaming**
- **Ability to change video quality**
- **Low infrastructure cost**
- **High availability and reliability**

### Key Statistics (2020)
- **2 billion monthly active users**
- **5 billion videos watched per day**
- **37% of mobile internet traffic comes from YouTube**
- Available in **80 languages**
- **$15.1 billion ad revenue** in 2019

## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Scope

### Core Functionalities
1. Upload videos
2. Watch videos

### Supported Platforms
- Mobile apps, web browsers, and smart TVs

### Assumptions
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** 5 million
- **Average Video Size:** 300 MB
- **Upload Limits:** Max 1 GB per video
- **Daily Storage Need:** 150 TB
- **CDN Costs:** 5 million * 5 videos * 0.3GB * $0.02 =  $150,000/day (using Amazon CloudFront)

## Step 2: High-Level Design

### Components

<div style="margin-left:3rem">
    <img src="./images/high-level-design.png" alt="High Level Design" width="400">
</div>

1. **Client:** Devices like smartphones, computers, and TVs.
2. **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Stores and streams videos.
3. **API Servers:** Handles all user interactions except video streaming (e.g., uploads, metadata updates).
4. **Metadata Database:** Stores video metadata (e.g., title, description, size).
5. **Original Storage:** Blob storage for uploaded videos.
6. **Transcoding Servers:** Convert videos into multiple resolutions and formats.
7. **Transcoded Storage:** Blob storage for transcoded videos.


---

### Core Workflows
#### 1. Video Uploading Flow
- **Parallel Processes:**
  1. Upload video to original storage.
  2. Update video metadata in the database.

- **Video Upload (Steps):**

    <div style="margin-left:3rem">
        <img src="./images/video-uploading-flow.png" alt="Video Upload Flow" width="500">
    </div>

    - [1] Videos are uploaded to blob storage. 
    - [2] Transcoding servers convert videos to multiple formats.
    - [3] One trasncoding is complete, following two steps are exectued in parallel.
        - [3a] Transcoded videos are sent to transcoded storage.
        - [3b] Transcoding completion events are queued in the completion queue. 
    - [3a.1] Videos are distributed to the CDN. 
    - [3b.1] Completion handlers update metadata and inform users. 



- **Metadata Upload (Steps):**

    <div style="margin-left:3rem">
        <img src="./images/metadata-upload.png" alt="Metadata Upload" height="500">
    </div>

    - The client in parallel sends a request to update the video metadata 
    - The request contains video metadata, including file name, size, format, etc.
    
       


#### 2. Video Streaming Flow

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
  <img src="./images/video-streaming-flow.png" alt="Video Streaming Flow" height="400">
</div>

- Videos are streamed directly from the CDN using edge servers to minimize latency.
- Some of te popular streaming protocols are MPEG_DASH, Apple HLS, Adobe HDS.
-  *Different streaming protocols support different video encodings and playback players.*

## Step 3: Design Deep Dive

### Video Transcoding
#### Importance
1. Raw video consumes large amounts of storage space. It Reduces storage space.
2. Ensures compatibility across devices and browsers.
3. Adapts video quality to network conditions.

#### Components
- **Container:** Encapsulates video, audio, and metadata (e.g., MP4, AVI).
- **Codecs:** Compression and Decompression algorithms (e.g., H.264, VP9).

#### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Model
<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
    <img src="./images/dag-video-transcoding.png" alt="DAG Video Transcoding" width="600">
</div>

- Transcoding a video is computationally expensive and time-consuming.
- DAG Model defines tasks like encoding, thumbnail generation, and watermarking.
- Allows high parallelism in video processing.


- The original video is split into video, audio, and metadata. 
    - Video encodings: Videos are converted to support different resolutions, codec, bitrates.
    - Thumbnail: It can either be uploaded by a user or automatically generated bythe system.
    - Watermark: Image overlay on top of your video contains identifying information about the video.

### Video Transcoding Architecture

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<img src="./images/video-transcoding-architecture.png" alt="Video Transcoding" width="600">
</div>

1. **Preprocessor:** Splits videos into smaller chunks (GOP alignment). It has 4 responsibilities.

    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <img src="./images/dag-config.png" alt="DAG Config" width="500">
    </div>

    - Video splitting: Video stream is split or further split into smaller Group of Pictures (GOP) alignment.
    - It split videos by GOP alignment for old clients.
    - It generates DAG based on configuration files client programmers write. 
    - It stores GOPs and metadata in temporary storage in case the encoding fails, the system could use persisted data for retry operations.


2. **DAG Scheduler:** Organizes tasks into sequential or parallel stages.
    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <img src="./images/dag-scheduler.png" alt="DAG Scheduler" width="500">
    </div>

    - It splits a DAG graph into stages of tasks and puts them in the task queue in the resource manager. 
    - Stage 1: video, audio, and metadata.
    - The video file is further split into two tasks in stage 2: video encoding and thumbnail. 


3. **Resource Manager:** Responsible for managing the efficiency of resource allocation.It
contains 3 queues and a task scheduler.
    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <img src="./images/resource-manager.png" alt="Resource Manager" width="700">
    </div>

    - Task queue: priority queue that contains tasks to be executed.
    - Worker queue: priority queue that contains worker utilization info.
    - Running queue: contains  currently running tasks and workers running the tasks.
    - Task scheduler: picks the optimal task/worker, and instructs the chosen task worker to execute the job.


4. **Task Workers:** Perform transcoding and other operations.
    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <img src="./images/task-worker.png" alt="Task Worker" width="250">
   </div>

    - Different task workers may run different tasks 


5. **Temporary Storage:** Stores intermediate data for retries.
    - The choice of storage system depends on factors like data type, data size, access frequency, data life span, etc. 
6. **Output:** Transcoded videos ready for distribution.

## System Optimizations

### Speed Optimizations
1. **Parallel Video Uploads:** Split videos into smaller chunks for faster, resumable uploads.

    <img src="./images/video-split.png" alt="Video Split" width="600">

2. **Distributed Upload Centers:** Use CDNs as upload hubs close to users.
3. **Parallel Processing:** Decouple modules using message queues for high parallelism.

    <img src="./images/message-queue1.png" alt="Message Queue" width="600">
    <img src="./images/message-queue2.png" alt="Message Queue" height="170" width="500">

### Safety Optimizations
1. **Pre-Signed URLs:** Restrict video uploads to authorized users.

    <img src="./images/pres-signed-urls.png" alt="Pre Signed" width="500">

2. **Protect Videos:**
   - **DRM Systems** (e.g., Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine).
   - **AES Encryption.**
   - **Watermarking.**

### Cost-Saving Optimizations
1. Serve only popular videos via CDN; less popular ones from high-capacity servers.
2. Encode on-demand for rarely accessed videos.
3. Regionalize video distribution based on popularity.
4. Build custom CDNs and partner with ISPs to reduce bandwidth costs.

## Error Handling
### Recoverable Errors
- Retry failed uploads, transcoding, or resource allocation tasks.

### Non-Recoverable Errors
- Stop malformed video processing and return error codes.
