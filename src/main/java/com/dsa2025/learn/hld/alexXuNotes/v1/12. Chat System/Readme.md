# Chapter 12: Design a Chat System

## Introduction
A **chat system** supports real-time messaging between users. This chapter focuses on designing a chat app that includes:
- **One-on-One Chat**
- **Group Chat (max 100 users)**
- **Online Presence Indicators**
- **Multiple Device Support**
- **Push Notifications**

The system targets **50 million daily active users (DAU)** and stores chat history permanently.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem

### Requirements
1. **Features:**
   - One-on-one and group chat (max 100 members).
   - Text-based messages (up to 100,000 characters).
   - Online/offline indicators.
   - Support for multiple devices.
   - Push notifications.
2. **Scale:** Design for 50 million DAU.
3. **Storage:** Permanent chat history.

## Step 2: High-Level Design

### Communication Protocols
1. **Sender Side:** HTTP for sending messages, leveraging persistent connections for efficiency.

      <div>

2. **Receiver Side:**
   - **Polling:**
      - Client periodically asks the server if there are messages available.
      - Inefficient due to frequent, redundant requests.

   - **Long Polling:** 
      - Keeps the connection open until messages arrive. 
      - Inefficient for inactive users.

   - **WebSocket:** 
      - A bi-directional, persistent connection for real-time communication, chosen for both sending and receiving messages.
      - Uses WebSockets (ws) protocol for sending and recieving messages.

### Components

   <img src="./images/high-level-statefull-arch.png" alt="High Level Architecture" height="350" width="550">
</div>

1. **Stateless Services:**
   - Handle signup, login, and user profile management.
   - Integrated with service discovery to recommend the best chat server.
2. **Stateful Services:**
   - Chat servers maintain persistent WebSocket connections.
   - Responsible for message delivery and synchronization.
3. **Third-Party Integration:**
   - Push notification services notify users about new messages.
   - Refer Notification System chapter for notifications implementation.

### Design

The client maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to a chat server for real-time messaging.

<div style="margin-left:3rem">
      <img src="./images/high-level-design.png" alt="High Level Design" width="450"> 
</div>

- Chat servers facilitate message sending/receiving.
- Presence servers manage online/offline status.
- API servers handle everything including user login, signup, change profile, etc.
- Notification servers send push notifications.
- Finally, the key-value store is used to store chat history.Key-value stores for the database of the chat history data for following reasons:
   - It allows easy horizontal scaling.
   - KV stores provide very low latency to access data.
   - Relational databases do not handle long tail of data well. When the indexes grow
   large, random access is expensive.
   - KV stores are adopted by other proven reliable chat applications. For example,
   both Facebook messenger and Discord.


Following are the data models for one-to-one chat and group chat.
   - The primary key is message id, which helps to decide message sequence.
   - For the group chat the composite primary key is (channel_id, message_id). 
      - IDs can be generated using a global 64-bit sequence number generator like Snowflake.
      - A better approach is to use local sequence number generator. Local means IDs are only unique within a group.
      - The reason why local IDs work is that maintaining message sequence within one-on-one channel or a group channel is sufficient.

## Step 3: Design Deep Dive

### Service Discovery

<div style="margin-left:3rem">
   <img src="./images/zookeeper.png" alt="Zookeeper" width="400">   
</div>

- The primary role of service discovery is to recommend the best chat server for a client based
on the criteria like geographical location, server capacity. 
- Uses **Apache Zookeeper** to allocate chat servers based on criteria like geographic location and server capacity.
- Ensures efficient load distribution and minimizes latency.


### Messaging Flows
#### One-on-One Chat


1. User A sends a message to Chat Server 1.
2. Chat Server 1 assigns a unique message ID and stores the message in a key-value store.
3. If User B is online, the message is forwarded to Chat Server 2, maintaining a persistent WebSocket connection.
4. If User B is offline, a push notification is sent.



#### Group Chat

<div style="margin-left:3rem">
   <img src="./images/group-chat-flow.png" alt="Group Chat Flow" width="400">  
</div>

- Messages are copied to individual inboxes for each recipient in the group.
- Simplifies synchronization but becomes expensive for larger groups.
- On the recipient side, a recipient can receive messages from multiple users. Each recipient
has an inbox (message sync queue) which contains messages from different senders.

---

#### Message Synchronization

Many users have multiple devices. We need to synchronize the message across the devices.
Each device maintains a variable called cur_max_message_id, which keeps track of the latest
message ID on the device. Messages that satisfy the following two conditions are considered
as news messages:

<div style="margin-left:3rem">
   <img src="./images/message-synchronization.png" alt="Message Synchronization"  width="400">  
</div>

- The recipient ID is equal to the currently logged-in user ID.
- Message ID in the key-value store is larger than cur_max_message_id

### Online Presence
1. **Heartbeat Mechanism:** 
   <div style="margin-left:3rem">
      <img src="./images/heartbeat-mechanism.png" alt="Heartbeat Mechanism" width="400"> 
   </div>
   
   - Clients send periodic heartbeats to presence servers to indicate they are online. 
   - If no heartbeat is received within a threshold (for eg x = 30), the user is marked offline.

     

2. **Fanout Model:** 

   <div style="margin-left:3rem">
      <img src="./images/fanout-presence.png" alt="Fanout Presence" width="400"> 
   </div>

   - Presence updates are pushed to friends using a publish-subscribe model in which each friend pair maintains a channel.
   - When User Aâ€™s online status changes, it publishes the event to three channels, channel A-B, A-C, and A-D. 
   - Those three channels are subscribed by User B, C, and D, respectively which get the online status updates.
   - The above design is effective for a small user groups.

## Additional Considerations
### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add servers as user count increases.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic evenly across servers.
- **Caching:** Reduce database load and improve latency.

### Error Handling
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Handle message delivery failures with retries and queuing.
- **Server Failures:** Use service discovery to allocate new servers in case of failures.

### Future Extensions
1. **Media Support:** Add handling for photos and videos, including compression and cloud storage.
2. **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensure message privacy.
3. **Client-Side Caching:** Reduce data transfer for better performance.
4. **Improved Load Times:** Use geographically distributed caching networks.
