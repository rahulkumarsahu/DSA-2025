# 🛠️ System Design Interview Preparation Guide

I spent a couple of months preparing for system design interviews, and let me tell you—it’s a journey. After going through countless resources, I narrowed it down to a few game-changers that helped me land offers from multiple big tech companies.

The LeetCode community has been super helpful throughout my prep, so I wanted to give back with this guide. If you’re gearing up for system design interviews, here’s a list of **awesome resources and practical tips** to help you **crush it**.

## 📘 1. The Basics

### 1a. [System Design Primer by Donne Martin](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
Start here. This is *the* definitive starting point. Go through every single topic thoroughly.

- Step-by-step explanations
- Helps answer “what” and “why” behind every concept  
  **Pro tip:** Interviewers love deep dives—so master the core concepts first.

### 1b. *Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)* by Martin Kleppmann
A must-read book on:

- Distributed systems
- Database internals
- Scalability

> Try to read a bit daily. Every chapter is a goldmine.

## 🎥 2. Amazing Videos

### [System Design Interview - YouTube (by Mikhail)](https://www.youtube.com/@SystemDesignInterview)
Instructor for LeetCode's premium course. Limited videos, but every one is packed with insights.

## 📚 3. Alex Xu: The OG

Grab both versions of Alex Xu’s books.

- Book 1: Great for introduction
- Book 2: Deep dive topics like 2PC, CAP theorem, load balancing, etc.

> Tip: When a topic is mentioned (e.g., 2PC), explore it in depth outside the book too.

Most interviews = **60 mins**. Here’s the time breakdown:
